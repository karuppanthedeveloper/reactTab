Select merchandise and make it available to the customer 2. Protect the profitability of the retailer 3. Protect the branding and values of the retailer We discussed how the market place, and a number oriented approach to merchandising has taken away the role of the \u201cartful\u201d merchandiser, who had to make several judgement calls. In this piece, we will examine how pricing, and thus the profitability of the retailer has been impacted by the marketplace. Out of literally thousands of items that a retailer can sell, the traditional approach was to select a few, perhaps a couple of hundred thousand, and focus on making profits from these. Some of these items were priced lower to attract traffic. Some items were sold just because their customers would expect the retailer to offer these items. Yet others were stocked and sold to be in tune with seasons, whilst some of these items were sold to make it convenient to the consumer, for example, ready-to-eat-meals, ties and stockings, single serve beverage cans, etc. But, the most important was those items that the retailer was known for, where consumers expected value and an expectation of exclusivity. In general, the traditional approach was to make margins from the last category, the convenience category, and the seasonal category during the season. There was a definite expectation that when new items were introduced, the margins would be high, and that these margins would decrease as the merchandise became less novel and more accepted. On seasonal items, the expectation was that, during the season, the margins were high, and that after the margin, any merchandise remaining would be disposed off at increasingly lower margins. Before the advent of comparison shopping and dynamic pricing, prices used to fluctuate depending on the lifecycle of the product or seasonality. With the advent of comparison shopping, where prices are widely available on apps, price transparency is common place, and consumers can easily migrate to those places where lower prices are available. During the early days of online shopping, consumers would walk into physical stores to look at the product, learn about its features, then use an app to locate the lowest price, and buy the same product from the lower priced retailer (which often was Amazon). Called showrooming, this caused the best retailers to revisit their pricing strategies. Price matching became common, and retailers often coped by encouraging add-on sales. When online retailers changed their prices, so did the brick and mortar retailers. By offering superior service, and better product knowledge to their consumers, retailers managed to survive and thrive in the era of extremely competitive pricing and margin protection. Market place, comparison shopping and dynamic pricing has taken away the smugness of most retailers, who now have to compete for their consumer\u2019s attention in order to remain profitable and survive."),o.a.createElement("div",{label:"Petcare"},"It\u2019s A Good Time To Be In Pet Products Retail Statistics from American Pet Products Association (APPA) reveal that over half of the households in the USA (roughly 68%) own a pet \u2013 accounting for more than 80 million homes. The USA pet industry climbed to $86 billion in 2017 and continues to have a strong growth momentum even in 2018. Here are the stats from the 2017-2018 APPA National Pet Owners Survey. Market research firm, Packaged Facts, estimates that overall pet food sales increased almost 6% and topped $26 billion in 2017. Now is a good time to be in pet products retail business because the amount of money spent is huge. The annual revenue growth rate of pet industry has been an unstoppable 5.4% since 2002 and mind you, the recession had no effect on it. Pet humanisation will to continue to drive sales Pet owners are increasingly treating their dogs, cats and even small mammals like members of their family. A recent study by Rover.com found that 94% of American pet owners consider them part of the family. The report further mentions that pet owners consider themselves as their parents and are highly committed to their care. For instance, they would make up songs to sing to their dogs (24 percent), share more pictures online of their dog than of friends and family (29 percent), and will even consider ending a relationship if their dog does not like their partner (54 percent). As per Washintonpost, pet-related hashtags on Instagram are a success returning hundreds of millions of posts. The owner-pet relationship is a hit on social media platforms too, 65% of pet owners post about their pet two times a week 16% post about their pet four times a week 17% have created social profiles for their pets Pet influencers engage 10x as many users as human influencers do. Another study found that brands saw up to 295% more comments on content with pets, and on average saw an 89% increase. Households\u2019 pets spending to increase American Pet Products Association (APPA) says that there is a huge concentration of pets in the US that are in need of grooming and healthy pet foods. Not to stay behind are healthcare products. Pet owners are similarly concerned about preventive health care for their pets with many of the opinion that the foods they buy can make a difference. In the Packaged Facts February/March 2017 National Pet Owner Survey, more dog and cat owners (76% and 71%, respectively) than in previous years of the survey agree with the statement \u201cHigh-quality dog foods/cat foods are effective for preventive health care.\u201d AAPA estimate that Households are likely to spend $6 billion over the next few years on just pet grooming. Currently, an average pet grooming costs anywhere between $50-$90. AAPA estimates that pet foods, supplements and health products are likely to reach $30 billion in turnover in the next few years Overall, if you are looking to get into pet products retail business, there is a huge opportunity to make big.  "),o.a.createElement("div",{label:"Retail Technology"},"Retail, like other industries, has its fair share of problems. Clients shift their loyalty, profits are elusive, merchandise may not be in stock, shrinkage happens, prices change, etc. For every one of these, there are dozens of solutions. No retailer that I know of is ever short of ideas. They get some of the shrewdest ideas, the cleverest use of technology and the slickest application of technology and ideas to solve problems. However, what is often missed in retail is that at the store end of retail, the problem is one of scale.Consider a retailer having 2,000 stores. Even a simple innovation that costs $100 per unit, if required to be deployed in retail stores for this retailer will now cost $2 million per instance of application. In many cases, there will have to be multiple instances of application, such as one tablet per sales associate, or one device per check-out lane or per shelf. If there are 10 such instances per store, then the cost of deployment, just for hardware, has suddenly shot up to $ 20 million. This does not include the business cost of developing training programs, and imparting training to associates in stores who have to use them. The training cost will have to include the time the associates are away from their regular job to attend the training costs. Retailers regularly spend around 1% or less of their annual revenue on IT. More than half of this is on regularly recurring expenditure such as licenses and salary costs of IT employees who maintain these applications. The other half a percent is available for new developments or modifications. Given such a scenario, no retail CIO will encourage discussion of any innovation that will cost more money than s/he has for regular IT operations. Even the most promising of innovative ideas will not find sympathy with the non-IT C level executives in a retail environment that is hard pressed to make and meet margin and growth targets. Retailers have always been known to struggle to meet margin and growth targets. Retailers with deep pockets, such as Walmart or Amazon can every now and then afford to experiment with innovative ideas. Every viable ideas will be more acceptable in an Amazon environment than in a Walmart environment. The reason? Amazon has far fewer store and deployment needs than Walmart. This is one of the main reasons that Amazon is often seen as a giant in innovation and in advancement of retail. The reason is not lack of ideas, but the economy of implementing them. "),o.a.createElement("div",{label:"Beauty"},"The Sephora effect: How the retailer wields its power to boost new beauty brands By now, most makeup junkies are familiar with Milk Makeup, the beauty brand founded by Milk Studios\u2019 founder Mazdack Rassi and his wife, Zanna Roberts Rassi, a fashion editor and E! News correspondent. It also checks off all the popular millennial-branding boxes: It\u2019s minimalist, gender-neutral and vegan. But rather than its industry-figure founding or trendy brand values, its name recognition can largely be contributed to Sephora, its biggest retail partner. \u201cAs a new brand starting out, it provided us with a platform, and it\u2019s been our largest brand awareness vehicle by far,\u201d said Milk\u2019s chief marketing officer, Nicole Frusci. Although Milk Studios \u2014 a photography studio that moonlights as a show space \u2014 is well-known among the fashion circles in New York and Los Angeles, the beauty brand was going to need more than that association to expand beyond its bubble, said Frusci. Hence the brand\u2019s decision to launch exclusively on Sephora.com and in 50 of its doors two years ago. Since then, it expanded to selling on its own website, and at select Urban Outfitters locations, but Sephora remains its most lucrative channel. It\u2019s now in 279 of the retailer\u2019s doors and has plans to roll into more this year. \u201cSephora is the leader in the industry \u2014 it\u2019s a no-brainer to be front and center with a retailer like them,\u201d said Frusci. Milk isn\u2019t the only brand thanking Sephora for its industry prominence. Ouai, the buzzy haircare brand founded by celebrity hair stylist Jen Atkin, has seen similar success since it launched exclusively with Sephora in 2016. It\u2019s now sold in 1,000 of Sephora\u2019s U.S. doors and has expanded internationally with the retailer, to locations like Canada and France. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped to spread brand awareness for Ouai with audiences all over the world,\u201d said Atkin. Annie Lawless, the founder of Suja Juice, said that when she debuted her newest project, Lawless, a clean lipstick line, on Sephora.com on March 9, it sold out within an hour. Although Lawless is an influencer in her own right (with 181,000 followers on Instagram), her brands\u2019 presence in the central \u201cNew Arrivals\u201d gallery on the site\u2019s front page (unpaid, she said) likely contributed to its success. For newcomers to the beauty industry, hitting it big with Sephora has become the barrier-to-entry for overall success. Beyond the obvious Indeed, it\u2019s not simply Sephora\u2019s status or widespread distribution that matters, it\u2019s what the company does for the youngest brands it partners with \u2014 namely, featuring them prominently across its website and social content, as well as in its popular sampling program. As the business intelligence firm L2 recently pointed out in its Indie Index report, younger, independent brands accounted for half of all brand mentions across Sephora\u2019s social channels and newsletters in the third quarter of 2017. The retailer also tends to place these indie brands above their more established competitors on its shopping pages in exchange for exclusive launches, \xe0 la Milk, the report found. In Milk\u2019s case, that extra exposure was rolled into its initial exclusive partnership plan with the retailer, said Frusci. The same is true for Hush, a new hair-care line launched by the private label manufacturer Mana. Since it launched its Prism temporary hair dye on Sephora.com in late February, Sephora has regularly promoted it on Instagram and kept it rotating in its homepage website galleries, like its \u201cTop Rated\u201d and \u201cRecommended for You\u201d sections. According to Hush\u2019s chief marketing officer, Louise Hewlett Butler, the brand saw an immediate spike in views and followers on its own website and Instagram account as a result. Some of the brands that are promoted heavily across the retailer\u2019s site and social channels, however, prefer to stay mum on any behind-the-scenes relationships. Huda Beauty and Ouai, for example, refused to comment on whether or not they had made a deal with Sephora to go this extra mile for them. Sephora representatives, for their part, were not available to weigh in. Still, Atkin confirmed that whenever Sephora shares Ouai-centric content on its own social channels, it has an impact: \u201cIt [helps with] product education and [acts as a] teachable moment for their audience.\u201d For many brands, especially those without the star power of Ouai, that kind of sharing can be a game changer, said Maya Mikhailov, the chief marketing officer of GPShopper, a mobile retail app developer. \u201cA simple re-gram from Sephora could be what moves the needle for individual brands to get consumers curious, and maybe even head to a store to try them out,\u201d she said."),o.a.createElement("div",{label:"Resources"},"Retail Industry is currently in a very dynamic state, and some interesting changes are on the horizon.
